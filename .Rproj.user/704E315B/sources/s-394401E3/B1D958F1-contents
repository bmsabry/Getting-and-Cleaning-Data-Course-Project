This code book describes the variables names used in the run_analysis.R


Xtest is the raw x data from the test
ytest is the raw y data from the test


Xtrain is the raw training x data
ytrain is the raw training y data

X is a data frame that combines both the test and training data for the X
Y is a vector that combines both the test and training data for the Y

features has the names of the variables of the X data frame

Activites has the names of the activites from the y vector

mean is a list that has all the variables from the features or X variables that has the word mean in it
Mean is a list that has all the variables from the features or X variables that has the word Mean in it
std is a list that has all the variables from the features or X variables that has the word std in it

Interest is a list that combines all the variables we are interested in. They have the word mean, Mean, std as well as Activites since
we are interested in the Y activites as well.

featuressubset is a subset of the features with the only variables we are interested in

Data is a data frame with the X and Y combined. All the variables have meaningful names
# This is the 1,2 and 3 delivarbles required per the problem statement. See the readme file.

Datasubset is a data frame which is a subset of Data and it has in it only the mean, Mean and std continaing variables
# This is the required assignment deliverable 4. # See the read me file

DatasubsetGroupedSummary is a data frame which has the data summarized by activites.
# Deliverable number 5. See the read me file
